# Movie Database

Created a movie data base using python and postgresSQL as the database to keep all the data. Used python to access the database I created on postgresSQL and write to it using my python program. HW6.py is used to add new movies to the database and HW6Query.py is used to search for movies by either title name or by year of release. After we either search for a movie or add a new movie, it prints out the movies in the database or the queried movies. **SWITCH BRANCH TO SEE SOURCE CODE**
